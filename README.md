# My Personal Website / Portfolio

This is the source code for my personal website.
The design of the site is based on a template sourced from html5up.net.
Of course, the content (i.e. information, images) of the website is my own.

I was eager to create a website for myself where I could give visitors (potential employers or others) an overview of who I am and links to other social media such as LinkedIn.

I was also eager to learn a bit about AWS and get my hands dirty with it, as having knowledge of AWS is critical for today's software engineers, especially in a DevOps environment. The goal here was to host the website source code in this repository and connect to AWS Amplify to actually host the website itself.
