# My Personal Website / Portfolio

<a href="https://www.seanmeenaghan.com" target="_blank">https://www.seanmeenaghan.com/</a>

This is the source code for my personal website.
The design of the site is based on a template sourced from html5up.net.
The content additions to the website are my own, of course.
Using a template was a choice I made so that I could quickly create an attractive and responsive website to introduce myself from.
- _Update June 2025: I would like to update this site in the near future, deprecating the template and making this a truly custom creation of my own._ 

I wanted to create a website for myself where I could give visitors a more in-depth overview of who I am that a resume cannot, and links to other social media such as [my LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/seanmeenaghan/) and GitHub. I think having a personal website created from scratch is fitting for any software engineer, even more backend systems-focused engineers such as myself!.

I was also eager to learn about AWS and cloud-computing in general, and get hands-on with it, as having hyperscaler knowledge can be critical for many of today's software engineers, especially in a DevOps environment.

To achieve both of these goals, I am using AWS Amplify to host the website sourced from this repository. I then used AWS Route 53 to register an appropriate domain name for my website.
