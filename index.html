								<p>Since March 2019, I have been working diligently to complete a Bachelors of Science degree program majoring in Software Development at Western Governors University. Completing my coursework at an accelerated pace, I am swiftly approaching graduation with a target of November 2021.</p>
								<p>My coursework and learning path has primarily taught me a great deal about Java, including using JavaFX with FXML to create GUI applications, as well as JDBC to connect Java applications to a SQL database. To see examples of these projects and more, you can view the source code for many of my projects by visiting <a href="https://github.com/s-meenaghan7" target="_blank">my GitHub profile.</a></p>
								<p>My coursework has given me a solid foundation in software engineering principles, design, the software development lifecycle, object-oriented programming, and foundational knowledge of basic data structures as well as algorithm design and analysis.</p>
								<p>With the culmination of my degree program approaching, I am currently seeking employment (or internship) with an organization as an associate, apprentice, new grad or junior level software engineer (in-office or remote). Although I currently am most proficient with Java and the backend of development, I am open to any position and confident in my abilities to learn new technologies or languages quickly and adapt to change rapidly.</p>

								<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
								<!-- <span class="image main"><img src="" alt="" /></span> -->
								<p>I have resided in the greater Seattle area for over 3 years with my partner Bekah, her daughter Ava, and our dog, Buddy. The online nature of Western Governors University means we all spend lots of time together at home, even when I'm studying all day.</p>
								<p>When I allow myself a break from working on software projects, studying, or honing my skills in various programming languages, I enjoy improving myself in other facets of my life. In particular, I enjoy lifting weights in the gym as well as playing electric guitar.</p>
