# My Personal Website / Portfolio

This is the source code for my personal website.
The design of the site is based on a template sourced from html5up.net.
The content additions to the website are my own, of course.
Using a template was a choice I made so that I could quickly create an attractive and responsive website to introduce myself from.

I wanted to create a website for myself where I could give visitors (potential employers or anyone else) a more indepth overview of who I am that a resume cannot, and links to other social media such as LinkedIn and GitHub.

I was also eager to learn about AWS and even get my hands dirty with it, as having knowledge of AWS is critical for today's software engineers, especially in a DevOps environment (or, at least for companies that use AWS, which according to the vast majority of job descriptions I've come across, is quite a few).

To achieve both of these goals, I am using AWS Amplify to host the website sourced from this repository. I then used AWS Route 53 to register an appropriate domain name (<a href="https://www.seanmeenaghan.com" target="_blank">www.seanmeenaghan.com</a>) for my website.
