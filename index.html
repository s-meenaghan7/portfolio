								<!-- <span class="image main"><img src="#" alt="" /></span> -->
								<p>I decided to leap into the field of software engineering and the tech industry as a whole, following a successful 3.5 year career as a welder in the shipbuilding industry. Beginning my endeavor in March 2019, I enrolled in a Bachelor of Science in Software Development degree program with Western Governors University. Less than 3 years later in January 2022, I have graduated with my degree successfully, and I am looking forward to doing and learning more as a new graduate software engineer in a professional environment.</p>
								<p>My coding experience is primarily in <strong>Java</strong> and focused on applying what I've learned about object-oriented programming and design, but I also am competent with languages like Python, SQL, C++, and HTML5/CSS3.</a></p>
								<p>I am currently seeking employment (or internship) with an organization as an associate, apprentice, new grad or junior level software engineer (in-office or remote). Although I currently am most proficient with Java and the backend of development, I am open to any position and confident in my abilities to learn new technologies or languages quickly and adapt to change rapidly.</p>

								<p>Currently, I do not have any apps or projects hosted online, but you can view the source code for several personal projects of mine by visiting <a href="https://github.com/s-meenaghan7" target="_blank">my GitHub profile.</a> I have included detailed README files within each repository to give an overview of each project.</p>

								<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
								<!-- <span class="image main"><img src="" alt="" /></span> -->
								<p>I have resided in the greater Seattle area for over 3 years with my partner Bekah, her daughter Ava, and our dog, Buddy.</p>
								<p>When I allow myself a break from working on software projects, studying, or honing my skills in various programming languages, I enjoy improving myself in other facets of my life. In particular, I enjoy lifting weights in the gym as well as playing electric guitar.</p>
