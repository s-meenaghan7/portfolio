# My Personal Website / Portfolio

This is the source code for my personal website.
The design of the site is based on a template sourced from html5up.net.
Of course, the content additions (i.e. information, images) of the website is my own.

I wanted to create a website for myself where I could give visitors (potential employers or others) an overview of who I am and links to other social media such as LinkedIn.

I was also eager to learn about AWS and even get my hands dirty with it, as having knowledge of AWS is critical for today's software engineers, especially in a DevOps environment. The goal here was to host the website source code in this repository and connect to AWS Amplify to actually host the website itself. Two birds with one stone!
